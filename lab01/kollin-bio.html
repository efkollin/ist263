        Hello my name is Eliza Kollin. I am a Junior majoring in Information management of technology with an interest in project management. I am currently a member of the Renne Honors program here at Syracuse University. I have always had an interest in technology, specifically technology that is used in the medical field. Over time, I started taking more technology classes and became interested in a wide range of fields, specifically project management. I have always been a very hands-on person, and I love working with people in order to solve a problem. Outside of school, I love hanging out with friends and family, skiing, playing sports, and watching tv.
