    <div id="content" class="israel"><h2>Israel is a small county in the middle east, about the size of New Jersey, located on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea. The country has a strong economy, landmarks of significance to several religions, and is home to over 9 million people. In the summer of 2022, I was lucky enough to call this amazing country my home. My name is Eliza Kollin, and I am a Jewish 20-year-old born and raised in Livingston, New Jersey. If four years ago you told me I was going to be living in Israel for three months, I would have thought you were crazy. </h2></div>

<p> I have always been a home body, never wanting to leave home. Going to college was a big adjustment for me, but I knew it was time to make some changes in my life. My sophomore year of college I decided to apply for a program called Onward Israel, which allows me to live in Israeli for three months, while also having the chance to work for an Israeli company as an intern. I didn’t know a single person going to Israel, but I knew this was something I needed to do for myself. From May 23rd to August 7th, I was no longer the little girl that couldn’t leave her parents, I was an independent young adult, ready to take on anything.</p>
<p>Living is Israel was very different than living in America. The people were nicer, the food was better, and life in general was just easier. I felt like the absolute best version of myself and woke up with a smile on my face every morning. Every day was different, but I always had a routine that kept me in check and allowed me to feel in control. Every morning I would wake up and walk to aroma to get coffee. I would get an iced aroma, which was basically ice coffee with sweetener. After I would walk to get coffee, I would come back and get ready for work.  I would pack my lunch, pack my backpack, and walk 15 minutes to the Nitsba Building, which is where I worked. I loved going to work every day. My coworkers were incredible, and I learned so much from my internship. Every day after work I would go home and meet up with all my friends. We either would go to the beach and bring food or plan to go out for dinner together.</p>

<p> The great part about living in Israel was that there was always something to do. Whether I was going to the beach, eating at a five-star restaurant, or going site seeing, I was truly never bored. I lived in Tel Aviv for most of the summer but spent a lot of time traveling to all different landmarks in Israel. I spent a lot of time in Jerusalem, Haifa, Jaffa, Eilat, and more. No matter what I was doing, I was also learning something new, which made me fall in love with Israel more and more every day. </p>
