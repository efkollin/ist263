    <p9>I had only been a lifeguard, camp counselor, and a teaching assistant before I went to Israel. I had never had a job that had anything to do with my major or what I wanted to do as a profession. I am currently Majoring in Information Management of Technology with a concentration in Project Management. Going into this summer, I thought I would be shadowing my coworkers, not really doing any hands-on work. However, that was not the case. This summer I interned for Cydome Security. Cydome is a cyber security company that provides cyber security coverage for protecting IT and Operational assets while assuring readiness for regulatory inspections. It is a team that consist of maritime and cyber security professions, ex-naval officers, Big Data, Data privacy and security experts who have joined forces to address the unique challenges of cybersecurity at sea.  I spent the summer working on the PR team, security team, and as a computer engineer working on their computer system. I was working in multiple different areas of the company with a wide range of employees. I learned a lot from every aspect that I worked in, and it allowed me to see which aspect of the company I enjoyed working in the most.</p>
    <p10>The work week in Israel is very different than the work week in America. Due to the fact that Shabbat starts on Friday night, the work week is from Sunday to Thursday. This was something I had to adjust to but ended up liking more than working a normal Monday to Friday. On Fridays, the entire country shuts down for shabbat. All restaurants, shops, and stores close. It honestly was amazing to experience because everyone takes Friday to focus on themselves and be with their families for the holiday. When I was in Israel, I would spend my Fridays at the beach with my friends, and then would take the time to call my family so we can light the candles together. Even though I was thousands of miles away from my family, being in Israel allowed me to connect with my family in different way, which ended up bringing us even closer together. </p>

    <p11>Working in Israel was not easy at first. The language barrier was very difficult, impacting my ability to communicate with my coworkers and bosses efficiently. Many of my coworkers spoke English but preferred to speak in Hebrew. In the beginning it was hard for me to form relationships with anyone because everyone would always speak in Hebrew, which I never can understand. Although listening and learning to speak Hebrew is fascinating, it is a very difficult language to understand, and an even harder language to learn. Many clients of Cydome Security only spoke Hebrew as well, making it difficult for me to communicate with them when given tasks at work. </p>

    <p12>Although there were challenges working in Israel this summer, it overall was an amazing experience. I grew as an employee in the workforce and learned many life skills that I will continue to use in my future endeavors. I also learned a lot about myself, and what I want to do as I continue to work. I left for Israel as a girl who never thought she could do anything without her parents and came back to America a confident and independent young woman, excited to take on any obstacle thrown at her. This was an experience I truly will never forget, and I am so blessed to have gotten the opportunity to work and live in Israel. Going to Israel was the best decision I have ever made for myself, and little did I know that it would change my life forever. </p>
